## My Tiny Café

*March 2025 - ongoing*

![Landing page for My Tiny Café](/public/mytinycafe.png)

[The app is available here (it's free!)](https://mytinycafe.com/)

My Tiny Café is a project I built specifically for my family—my daughter and my wife—so they could easily order hot beverages the moment they come back home. Honestly, sending a text usually resulted in too little information about what they really wanted. Now, they use a custom interface to place their exact, personalized order. Plus, it just feels much more professional, which is a fun little perk! We live in a small, remote town, and using this system makes our home feel just like a fancy coffee shop. If you also feel the urge to become a home barista for your friends and family, why not check it out? [My Tiny Café](https://mytinycafe.com/) is free for all to use!

[The website here](https://hormur.com/)

Since 2022 I am the main frontend developer for the startup [Hormur](https://hormur.com) whose goal is to democratize all kinds of arts in places not dedicated for it. The webapp acts as an intermediation platform to empower artists and hosts to discover each other. The service notably allows the organization of events with a ticketing system and redistribution of benefits. Public release in summer 2023 !

## Habilitrak

*October 2023*

![Habilitrak](/deviceframes-habilitrak.png)

[Demo here](https://habilitrak.krlx.fr/)

A web app to help track habilitations of employees. Including :
- a dashboard
- custom reminder notification periods
- habilitation passport pdf generation

Initially a missed opportunity for a freelance mission, I found the idea interesting to implement anyway and play with new tools. Leveraging the permissive free tier offered by [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io), most of the app is free to use, only some features need a payment ([send me an email](mailto:alix@krlx.fr)).

## Medical Score Calculator

*March 2020*

![Fournier's Severity Index Calculator](/fournier.png)

[Demo here](https://loving-ride-53e79f.netlify.app/#/)

In 2020, a friend of mine was doing his doctoral thesis on this illness and was tasked to calculate a lot of Severity Indexes for a dataset of past patients from the hospital. A Severity Index is a score calculated from the patient's vitals that acts as an indicator for the seriouness of the illness. In the case of Fournier's Gangrene, a high score (>9) often means death.

From this time consuming and repetitive task, we thought that it would be helpful to have a calculator app to compute the Severity Index of Fournier's Gangrene. None of the current medical calculator apps available on the stores did provide anything for this disease.Our goals with this app were:
- Visualize and complete easily the parameters needed for the calculation
- Visualize the incidence of each parameters on the severity index
- Have a minimal number of interaction
- Create a PWA that could be installed on the home screen of iPhone and Android
